These experiments can best be part of an Arduino workshop for kids. Where did this book come from? In Nov 2017 I was part of two days Arduino workshop for kids. My work was to create the content and conduct (as a resource person) the workshop. There were 20 participants in the age group less than 19 years. Participants took part in 15 challenges (Arduino projects) which progressively increase in difficulty. It was an awesome experience seeing the young ones taking immense interest and standing up to the challenges. The workshop was covered by local newspaper and was thoroughly praised. To better help the outreach of this workshop among the young kids, I created this book. It includes everything that was in the workshop. The goal is to help the curious young minds by giving them a head start in developing electronics projects. Therefore the workshop contents are made available in the form of a free and easy-to-access book. Also, in this way, I can contribute my part to the open-source community. Who is this book for? This book is primarily written for young kids who have no experience with electronics projects. The structure of the book is kept simple and the writing is easy to follow. Its not only for kids but anyone who has just started working with Arduino can use these projects as their journey towards learning. What this book is  for kids to kick start their journey in electronics a reference guide to conducting Arduino workshop for kids a fun reading about the simple Arduino projects What this book is not  meant to teach advanced electronic concepts meant to teach advanced programming concepts Who am I? I am a PhD student at the National Institute of Technology Jalandhar. I enjoy working on electronics hardware/software projects and learning new tools &amp; technologies. When not working, I like running and cycling. You can find more about me at - https://kulbhushanchand.github.io/about/ Support this work  I support open-source hardware/software and open science. Therefore, this version of this book will always be freely available! However, creating content and updating the book takes a lot of effort. So, if you like this book and want to support its development, consider supporting this work in the following ways. It will help me a lot!

I am also thankful to Mr. and Mrs. Indrajeet Paintel for conceiving the idea and arranging the infrastructure and logistics for the workshop. I also appreciate the help from my lab mates Mr. Gajender Singh and I also want to acknowledge the open-source tools used in some parts of this project. Fritzing is used to create the connection diagram. drawio-desktop is used to create the logo and diagrams. "],["what-is-arduino.html", "Chapter 1 What is Arduino 1.1 Arduino board 1.2 Arduino pinout", " Chapter 1 What is Arduino Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards can read inputs like light falling on a sensor, a finger pushing on a button, or even a Twitter message - and turn it into an output like activating a motor, turning on/off an LED, publishing something online. In simple terms, Arduino acts as the brain in an electronic project. It handles all the information, decides the actions based on the information received, and created the required output. 1.1 Arduino board Find more about the Arduino Uno board on their official website. Figure 1.1: (Top row: left to right) Unboxing the Arduino, front side; (Bottom row: left to right) isometric view, back side 1.2 Arduino pinout The name of the most used available pin on the Arduino board is shown below. You will find yourself keep coming back to this figure, so its useful to print out this image or draw a rough sketch for a ready reference. Figure 1.2: Arduino pinout "],["tools-required.html", "Chapter 2 Tools required 2.1 Hardware tools  2.2 Software tools ", " Chapter 2 Tools required You will need some important hardware and software tools to take on the forthcoming challenges. Let us get familiarize with them. The list of tools is subjected to change as new contents are added to the book. Anyway, the current list of tool is enough to take on the available challenges in the book. 2.1 Hardware tools  These are the main hardware tools that are required for experimentation. This list will grow as I add more challenges this book. Arduino Uno (x1) The challenges are designed for Arduino Uno board. Other popular Arduino boards like Arduino Mega 2560, Arduino Leonardo can also be used, but I recommend starting with Arduino Uno. See the Fig.1.1 to know how Arduino Uno board looks like. PC/Laptop (x1) Any desktop computer can be used to program the Arduino board. Make sure the PC has a free USB port to connect to the Arduino. USB Type-A to USB Type-B cable (x1) The Arduino is connected to the PC using a special USB cable. On one side it has a commonly found Type-A connector while other side has a less common Type-B connector that goes to the Arduino board. This cable serves dual purpose. First it helps to transfer data between the Arduino and the PC. Second it supplies power from the PC to the Arduino board. Breadboard (x1) The breadboard is the part which is used to temporarily connect different electronic components. It makes our life easier by allowing us to quickly join/un-join different wires, connect/disconnect different electronic components from the electronic circuit. Connecting wires (more than 20) Just like breadboard, the wires interconnects different electronic components but with greater flexibility. Even on the breadboard we need wires to connect different points together. We need a lot of them, the more the better. Power supply (x1) Electronic projects need power to run. Think of it like food for your body, or fuel for your car. For most of the projects the power that comes from the PC/Laptop via USB cable is sufficient. But, sometimes we need to take our project outdoors and it is difficult to carry the PC with us. So having a portable power supply comes in handy. A simple power supply comprises of two parts: 9V Battery Battery to barrel jack adaptor Input/Sensors The input devices or sensors are like eyes and ears for our projects. We need may need combination of different sensors based on the challenge. Push button Output/Actuator The output devices or actuators are like the the arms and legs for our projects. These are the output device which we can control. Red LED Other components We need few electronic components for various needs in the project. Think of these components like various organs in the body, each serving different function but acting together they serves a common purpose (i.e. to drive the body). The various components we need are: Resistors (320 ) 2.2 Software tools  Arduino IDE "],["challenge-1.html", "Chapter 3 Challenge #1", " Chapter 3 Challenge #1 "],["arduino-resources.html", "A Arduino resources", " A Arduino resources Arduino Cheatsheets Getting arduino help and inspiration online Other arduino books "],["references.html", "References", " References "]]
