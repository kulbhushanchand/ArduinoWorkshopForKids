These experiments can best be part of an Arduino workshop for kids. "],["where-did-this-book-come-from.html", "Where did this book come from? ", " Where did this book come from?  In Nov 2017 I was part of two days Arduino workshop for kids. My work was to create the content and conduct (as a resource person) the workshop. There were 20 participants in the age group less than 19 years. Participants took part in 15 challenges (Arduino projects) which progressively increase in difficulty. It was an awesome experience seeing the young ones taking immense interest and standing up to the challenges. The workshop was covered by local newspaper and was thoroughly praised. To better help the outreach of this workshop among the young kids, I created this book. It includes everything that was in the workshop. I intend to help curious young minds to create electronics projects by making available the workshop contents in the form of a free and easy-to-access book. Also, in this way, I can contribute my part to the open-source community. "],["who-is-this-book-for.html", "Who is this book for? ", " Who is this book for?  This book is primarily written for young kids who have no experience with electronics projects. The structure of the book is kept simple and the writing is easy to follow. Its not only for kids but anyone who has just started working with Arduino can use these projects as their journey towards learning. What this book is  for kids to kick start their journey in electronics a reference guide to conducting Arduino workshop for kids a fun reading about the simple Arduino projects What this book is not  meant to teach advanced electronic concepts meant to teach advanced programming concepts "],["who-am-i.html", "Who am I?

I am also thankful to Mr. and Mrs. Indrajeet Paintel for conceiving the idea and arranging the infrastructure and logistics for the workshop. I also appreciate the help from my lab mates Mr. Gajender Singh and I also want to acknowledge the open-source tools used in some parts of this project. Fritzing is used to create the connection diagram. drawio-desktop is used to create the logo and diagrams. "],["1-what-is-arduino.html", "Chapter 1 What is Arduino", " Chapter 1 What is Arduino Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards can read inputs like light falling on a sensor, a finger pushing on a button, or even a Twitter message - and turn it into an output like activating a motor, turning on/off an LED, publishing something online. In simple terms, Arduino acts as the brain in an electronic project. It handles all the information, decides the actions based on the information received, and created the required output.
